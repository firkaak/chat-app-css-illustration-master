## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

That things are possible, even if they don't seem like that.
There is not any animation yet, and the big purple header needs adjustments. Or a different shape.
